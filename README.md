# Tianchi Competition balloon navigation



Future Challenge

Helping Balloons Navigate the Weather



This contest is organized by Alibaba Cloud and the Met Office, the United Kingdom¡¯s national meteorological service, inviting data enthusiasts from around the world to develop solutions relating to a potential future world in which deliveries by unmanned balloons must be optimized to navigate the variability of the UK weather.

The scenario is set in the future¡ªin the year of 2050, a world where the invention of ¡°anti-gravity engines¡± has led to the creation of unmanned balloons as the preferred logistics solution. However, because of the UK¡¯s complex meteorological conditions, the balloons are occasionally delayed, damaged or even destroyed by extreme weather conditions causing disruption and loss. The contestants will be challenged to create algorithms that can plan flight routes for these balloons to navigate the endless variation and changeable nature across the UK to optimize their delivery schedules and costs.
